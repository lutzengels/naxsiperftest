\emph{Httperf} is a web server performance measurement tool developed by David Mosberger~\cite{mosberger1998httperf} at Hewlet-Packard Research Labs\footnote{http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/}. It was used to determine the maximum number of concurrent connections that \emph{Naxsi} is able to handle, as described in section~\ref{sec:Baseline performance measurement}. Details like the used parameters can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:Measurement results}.\\
To automate series of test likewise for \emph{Httperf} a perl-wrapper was written.
