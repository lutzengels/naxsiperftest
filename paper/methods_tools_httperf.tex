\emph{Httperf} is another web server performance measurement tool by Hewlet-Packard. As described in section~\ref{sec:Baseline performance measurement} it was used to determine the maximum number of concurrent connections that naxsi is able to handle. Details like the used parameters can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:Measurement results}.
