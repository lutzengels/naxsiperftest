The goal of the research described in this paper is to find out what the performance impact is when Naxsi is used as a web application firewall for the Nginx web server. The performance is measured for two different scenarios. First, by making the Nginx web server returning only \verb+HTTP 200 OK+ responses, the Naxsi performance impact becomes isolated. A more realistic scenario is also looked at by measuring the performance impact when Naxsi is protecting a Wordpress website. The overall performance impact of Naxsi is minimal. When analysing the results, it becomes clear that the performance impact of Naxsi becomes greater when the number of URL parameters increase. Also, when thousands of requests per second need to be handled by the Nginx web server, then Naxsi shows a visible impact on the web server.
