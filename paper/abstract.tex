The goal of the research described in this paper is to find out what the performance impact is when Naxsi is used as a web application firewall for the Nginx web server. The performance is measured for two different scenarios. First, by making the Nginx web server returning only \verb+HTTP 200 OK+ responses, the Naxsi performance impact becomes isolated. A more realistic scenario is also looked at by measuring the performance impact when Naxsi is protecting a Wordpress website.
