\emph{Autobench} is a Perl script that instruments \emph{httperf} to benchmark web servers. It offers extensive options, amongst which the ability to stepwise increase concurrent connections or the number of request. This results in graphs that visualize bottlenecks/tipping points. In the course of this project it has been used to confirm and visualize the threshold of number of concurrent connections that naxsi can handle (as described in section~\ref{sec:Baseline performance measurement}).
