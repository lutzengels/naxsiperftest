\emph{Autobench} is a Perl script that instruments \emph{httperf} to benchmark web servers. It offers extensive options, amongst which the ability to stepwise increase concurrent connections or the number of request. This results in graphs that visualize bottlenecks/tipping points. In the course of this project it has been used to determine the threshold of the maximum number of concurrent connections.~\ref{sec:Baseline performance measurement}
