\emph{Apache benchmark} is an open source web server benchmarking tool developed by Apache initially to test Apache web server installations.~\cite{apachebenchmark2013} However, it is not limited to Apache web servers, as it simulates regular HTTP/1.1 requests.\\
During the execution of the performance tests, \emph{Apache benchmark} is used when the number requests per second exceed the number of concurrent connections that are realistically possible. To be able to stepwise increase the number of URL parameters, as well as to calculate the average of repeated tests, a perl script is written to automate these operations~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lutzengels/naxsiperftest/blob/master/tools/bench.pl}}.  These experiments are explained later in this section.
