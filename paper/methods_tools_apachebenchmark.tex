\emph{Apache Benchmark} is an open source web server benchmarking tool developed by Apache initially to test Apache web server installations.\footnote{\url{http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html}} However, it is not limited to Apache web servers, as it simulates regular HTTP requests.\\
During the conduction of the performance testing \emph{Apache Benchmark} is used when the number requests per second exceeded the number of concurrent connections. To be able to stepwise increase parameters, as well as to calculate the mean of repeated tests, a perl script is written to automate these operations.
