\emph{Apache Benchmark} is an open source web server benchmarking tool developed by Apache initially to test Apache web server installations.\footnote{http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html} However, it is not limited to Apache web servers, as it simulates regular HTTP requests.\\
During the conduction of the performance testing \emph{Apache Benchmark} was used, when the number requests per second exceeded the number of concurrent connections. To be able to stepwise increase parameters, as well as to calculate the mean of repeated tests, a perl script has been written to automate these steps. The script is explained separately in section {\color{red}{(PLEASE ADD REFERENCE)}}~\ref{sec:}.
