This paper focusses only on the impact of Naxsi when \ac{URL} parameters are parsed. However, Naxsi not only inspects the \ac{URL} parameters, but it also inspects POST arguments, HTTP headers and the full URL, as is explained in section~\ref{sec:naxsi_whitelist}. The performance impact of these checks may be different compared to those that are measured during this research. Also, a combination of these checks may decrease the overall performance of the web server even further.
