This paper focusses only on the impact of Naxsi when \ac{URL} parameters are parsed. However, Naxsi not only inspects the \ac{URL} parameters, but it also inspects GET requests, POST requests and cookie HTTP headers. The performance impact of these checks may be different than that of which was measured during this research. Also a combination of these checks may decrease the overall performance of the web server even further.
