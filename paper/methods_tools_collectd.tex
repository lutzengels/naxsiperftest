Collectd\footnote{\url{http://collectd.org/}} is a daemon for unix-based operating systems that gathers performance statistics. It has a modular design, meaning that the collection of different kind of statistics (e.g. cpu-load or network-usage) is enabled or disabled by toggling the respective plugins and thereby minimizing resource usage. Furthermore, it only handles the data collection, leaving out the logic to create graphs, but storing the data in \ac{RRD} files. Programs like RRDtool in turn can easily create graphs from the RRD files. It is written in the fast and low impact programming language C~\cite{prechelt2000empirical} and designed to be run on e.g. embedded devices.

Collectd is configured on all servers of the experimental setup. \emph{Server01} to \emph{server04} are configured as clients, collecting their own local performance data. \emph{server05} also collects local performance data, but furthermore receives those from the clients. Eventually the \emph{Collection 3}\footnote{\url{https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Collection_3}} web-based front-end uses RRDtool to graph the collected data. Details can be found in appendix~\ref{sec:Configuration}.
