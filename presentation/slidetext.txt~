What is Green IT?
Implementing virtualization.
Equipment consolidation.
Upgrading to newer, more energy-aware equipment
Employing management systems to increase efficiency and availability. 

How can we extend GreenIT?
 * In short: Making network-nodes energy aware
 * In long:
   * way of monitoring equipment => energy profiling
   * availabiliy of monitoring data => distribution
   * using data for e.g. path decisioning 

Which of those is in place?
 * Monitoring = NMSOA
 * data = PDU/SNMP/Sensor (no standard!)
 * path = experimental setups in NRENS

What is this project about then?
 * determining capabilities and architectures of NMSOAs
 * extending a NMSOA to include energy data
 * by this make data available for e.g. path decisioning

What exactly is perfSONAR? 1/3
 * created in the JRA2 GEANT2
 * mainly used by NRENs and educational entities
 * implements the NMSOA-architecture
 * decentralized system that spans across multiple domains
 
What exactly is perfSONAR? 2/3
 * encapsulate basic functionalities within entities called services
 * unified protocol which assumes various roles by using OGF and NMWG
 * currently network performance only
 * doesn't handle energy-profiling atm

What exactly is perfSONAR? 3/3
 * describe why it's not possible to use perfSONAR

How to make GreenSONAR then?
 * define standard for energy profiling
 * implement in perfSONAR

Results
 * 
 * traffic flow model
 * metric

conclusion
 * It is not possible to extend perfSONAR within 4 weeks
