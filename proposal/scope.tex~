\label{sec:scope}
Our research looks at layer 2 topology discovery with the use of LLDP and the correlation between this layer and layer 3 topologies based on various protocols. We have selected a subset of layer 3 protocols, which are used in large and comlex networks that are also available at Sara where our research will be done. By structuring the layer 3 data provided by these protocols we aim at designing a modular extensible implementation to provide the correlation between layer 2 and layer 3. A module consists of a specific layer 3 protocol translation to structured data which can be used in our implementation. If indeed the correlation between the different layers is feasible, we would like to provide a framework that can be relatively easily extended in future work.

For layer 2 topology discovery we will focus on the use of LLDP. Little research has been done on LLDP and we want to find out how effectively LLDP can be used for correlating with layer 3. The efficienty and effectifness of LLDP topology discovery itself will not be researched. Our experiments will be conducted in a heteregeneous environment, which means that some devices will not support LLDP. Although it is necessary to explain missing infomation in the topology, it will be however outside of the scope to complement LLDP with other methods for topology discovery at layer 3.

What layer 3 protocols?

VLANS?
