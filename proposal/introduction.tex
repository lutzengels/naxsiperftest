In a time where huge botnets are utilized to attack services, it is ever more
important to protect your infrastructure. When taking into account the fact that
web services gain more market share it is the web servers that need to be
protected. One of those web servers is nginx. Compared to other web servers it is
light-weight, which attracts more users in time where power consumption of
infrastructure becomes important. Currently (February 2013) it holds 13\%
market share.

In 2011 development of Naxsi (\emph{Nginx Anti Xss \& Sql Injection}) started. As the (written
out) abbreviation implies it protects nginx from Cross-site scripting (XSS) and Sql
injection attacks. To do so it takes the whitelist approach, as to circumvent overly
complex and regular expression based rule sets. \\
This project aims at generating valuable data by conducting performance testing
of Naxsi in a number of scenarios.
