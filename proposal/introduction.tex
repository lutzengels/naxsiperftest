In a time where huge botnets are utilized to attack services, it is ever more
important to protect your infrastructure. When taking into account the fact that

light-weight, which attracts more users in time where power consumption of
infrastructure becomes important. \\
In 2011 development of Naxsi (\emph{Nginx Anti Xss \& Sql Injection}) started. As the (written

of Naxsi in a number of scenarios.
