Naxsi can be run in learning mode and production mode. Within our research we will focus on the performance of Naxsi in production mode. This means that we will have to find a good learning set for Naxsi to use, which fits are production environment. For our research we will look at a setup as can often be seen by blog hosters:
\begin{itemize}
\item MySQL database
\item Naxsi-Nginx web server
\item Wordpress 3.5.1
\end{itemize}
